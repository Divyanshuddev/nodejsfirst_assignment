# What is Node js ?
Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a programming language. Node.js is used to build back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, and so on. Node accepts the request from the clients and sends the response, while working with the request node.js handles them with a single thread. To operate I/O operations or requests node.js use the concept of threads. Thread is a sequence of instructions that the server needs to perform. It runs parallel on the server to provide the information to multiple clients. Node.js is an event loop single-threaded language. It can handle concurrent requests with a single thread without blocking it for one request.


# Features of Node js?
1. Easily scalable the application in both horizontal and vertical directions.
2. Node.js is much more preferable because of faster synchronization. Also, the event loop avoids HTTP overloaded for Node.js development.
3. It’s easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and agile development.
4. It provides the caching of a single module. Whenever there is any request for the first module, it gets cached in the application memory, so you don’t need to re-execute the code.
5. Large ecosystem for open source library and has asynchronous or non-blocking nature.
